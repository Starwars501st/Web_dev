        <h3>Some More Zelda information if your curious</h3>
           <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Zelda_Wiki" target="_blank"> More Zelda Info </a>

        <h3>#1 Skyward Sword </h3>
        <P> Skyward Sword originaly releasing on the Wii in 2011 and being forwarding to the switch in 2019. It's one of the most controversial games in the series, with some loving it and some hating it, due to it having motion controls and not the usual controler. It's the first game on the time line for all the zelda games lore and gives to most information on the land of Hyrule, The Triforce, Demise and Hylia, and the spirit of the hero etc, telling the story of how the kindom of Hyrule really started.     </P>

        <h3>#2 Ocarina of Time</h3>
        <p>Ocarina of Time made by Nintendo in 1998, was nintendo's first 3D Zelda game, which lead the way for many of the other 3D games of this series and is a very nostalgia game for many, the music was great and a story that truly brought life to the game. This game is what made the Zelda games so popular, and people loved the consept and characters as well as how deep the story felt.  </p>

        <h3>#3 Twilight Princess</h3>
        <p>Twilight princess first releasing on the Wii in 2006, was one of the most favorited Zelda games it was origanaly planned for the GameCube but ended up being on the Wii instead. It was also inspired by The lord of the rings for it's world and it's realistic and darker art style with other element echo Tolkien's work. And is personaly one of my favorite games.  </p>
        
        <h3>#4 Link's Awakening</h3>
        <p>Link's awakening is one of the older Zelda games released 1993, but was also released in 2019 on the switch. It is a bit different from the other games in the series due to it not having Zelda and Ganondorf in it. The entire game was not set in Hyrule but on an unnamed island in the middle of the ocean where they goal was to wake the wind fish.</p>

        <h3>#5 Breath of The Wild</h3>
        <p>Breath of the wild coming out in 2017 on the Nintendo switch was an instant hit being one of the first games released on the switch when it first came out. It's popularity coming from it's open-world design and it prioritizing players freedom and discovery which was unlike anyother Zelda game at the time. </p>

        <h3>#6 The Wind Waker</h3>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker is known for it's child like artstyle with it having the first appirentce of toon Link. Released on the Nintendo GameCube in 2002. It initially met with some player bachlash but is now a loved game for many. The game also included a flooded Hyrule, to adventure the seas instead of the land. I would say it's one of the most nostalgic for me personaly because of the time it came out. </p>

        <h3>#7 Echo's of Wisdom</h3>
        <p>Echo's of Wisdom is one of the more resent games releasing in 2024 being the only game where you play as Zelda instead of Link. Being in the same cute artstyle as link's awakening, and not having the player use a sword or shield, but instead having a wand that creates alies to fight for you. </p>
